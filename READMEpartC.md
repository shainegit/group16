We (Shaine and Tal) worked on this project as a part of the web development course. This project demonstrates the use of the following technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Mongo DB
5. Python Flask
   
Part 1-2
We created in this project an e-commerce store that allows its customers to buy electronic products. 
The customers are also able to sign up and see their product list.


The site is also using a reponsive design which allows it to fit on any screen.  

The HTML has a header and footer as well as a nav tags that keeps the consistency of the site. When the customer chooses different products, the site does not change its form which let the users to have a better experience since they can concentrate on the product itself and less on the elements around it.

The design of the site is mainly relaying on simplicity and consistency. The approach of responsive design were also used here in order to make sure that the site will be able to run on any screen size. Aside from that there are also animations that were added to give the site more "alive" like feeling to the user.

The JS code also provides validations for number of cases like password and email. 

Part 3-
In this part we tried to demonstrate the interaction with the mongoDB database and used Flask template project.
Added user registeration and login functionality.
Added contact page with database interaction
